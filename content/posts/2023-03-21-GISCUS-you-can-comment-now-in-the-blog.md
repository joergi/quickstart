When I was researching some stuff for a blog post about Github Actions, I [stumbled over the blog ](https://github.com/nicolasiensen/nicolasiensen.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml) from Github user [@nicolasiensen](https://github.com/nicolasiensen).   
When I read the post, I saw that people were able to add comments with being logged into Github.  
Something like this I have seen a long time ago, but this was so complicated, I just ignored it.  

But now as I saw in his blog , it's super ways, thanks to [Giscus](https://giscus.app)   
The setup was super easy, the repo must be public, you need to add the all to your repo and enable discussions.  
And the best is:  
* it's free
Ã— it's open-source
* it's tracking free

Let's see how long it will takes, until I will get the first real comment!

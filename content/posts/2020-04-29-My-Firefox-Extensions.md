"Many sites on the web offer some limited support for encryption over HTTPS, but make it difficult to use. For instance, they may default to unencrypted HTTP, or fill encrypted pages with links that go back to the unencrypted site. The HTTPS Everywhere extension fixes these problems by using clever technology to rewrite requests to these sites to HTTPS" *(description from the website)*

* [Privacy Badger ](https://privacybadger.org/) by [EFF](https://www.eff.org) *(also available for other browsers)*    
"Privacy Badger is a browser add-on that stops advertisers and other third-party trackers from secretly tracking where you go and what pages you look at on the web. If an advertiser seems to be tracking you across multiple websites without your permission, Privacy Badger automatically blocks that advertiser from loading any more content in your browser. To the advertiser, itâ€™s like you suddenly disappeared." *(description from the website)*

* [Measure-it](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/measure-it/) by Trishul *(also available for [Chromium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/measure-it/jocbgkoackihphodedlefohapackjmna))*
